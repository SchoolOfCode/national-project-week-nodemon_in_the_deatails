#Snippet-Snap

The code snippet app provided an improved way to document your daily reflections at the School of Code. The code snippet section provides a space that makes it easy for you to enter a code pattern that represents what you learnt on a particular day. The mood section shows 5 emoji which represents your mood for that day; the final section is a reflection text where you can put down your thoughts for the day and or what you struggled with that day.

### what the app does:

We've created a React frontend that fetches data from an Express backend with hosting at Netlify and Heroku respectively. Our data is stored in a Postgres database linked to the backend.

The API serves routes that deliver user information, user credentials, and posts.

Authentication checks usernames against passwords stored in database.

Problems solved along the way:
deployment problems
git merges
dealing with DRY issues while working in separate pairs
CSS IS AWESOME
